# cast-yt-from-terminal
Small bash script that i wrote for personal use. it simplifies a bit the process of sending a youtube video from the terminal to a chromecast using [castnow](https://github.com/xat/castnow "Castnow Github page") and [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl "youtube-dl Github page").
